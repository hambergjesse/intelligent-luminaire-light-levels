# Helvar Front-end Trainee Home Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the assignment completed by Jesse Hamberg. The task was to implement a component for setting light levels for an intelligent luminaire that has a PIR sensor to detect movement. The UI design should be similar to the reference provided, and the component should have 3 sliders representing different light levels.

## Implementation Details

This repository contains the solution for the assignment completed by Jesse Hamberg. The component was implemented using React and meets all the specified requirements.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hambergjesse/intelligent-luminaire-light-levels.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd intelligent-luminaire-light-levels
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:Â¨

```bash
npm run dev
```

_Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ to view the component._

Drag the sliders to adjust the light levels for the luminaire. The UI will update in real-time as you drag the sliders.

**Press the "Apply" button to apply the selected levels.** An alert will display the applied levels.

**Press the "Cancel" button to reset the sliders to their default values.** An alert will indicate that the user does not want to update the luminaire light levels.

_Please note that the component enforces certain restrictions on the slider values to ensure consistency, as specified in the assignment requirements. Refer to the implementation code for more details._
